// CLEAN CODES
// 1.  INDENTATION 
//  Code is indented for a reason because brackets are across multiple lines and the easiest way to visualize which code are inside which block that's why indentation is important. 

// 2. WHITE SPACES
// White space is important 
// There should be a single space either side of the operator 
// Make sure you don't clamp all your code together 

// 3. CREATE GOOD NAMES
// Naming conventions in javascript and some of them are unacceptable e.g. 123, let 

// let 123 = true; //Illegal 
// let let = "hello" // also illegal 

// let pla = 17; //bad
// function rd2p(){} // also bad

// let playerOneAge = 17; //good
// function round2DecimalPlaces () {} //good 

// Don't forget camel casing
// function speedofart(){} //bad 

// Camelcasing used to differentiate the words 
// function speedOfArt(){} // good

// Don't create meaningless names

// Use verbs for functions and nouns for variables 
// e.g function buildWord(){}, let levelMap ; 

// 4. FLAT IS BETTER THAN NESTED
// Nesting creates more dimensions of logic which is more harder for human brain to follow

// Flat puts all code in one line for human to understand 

// 5. DOCUMENTATION 
//  Write some comment's to explain code when the process is pretty complex!
